      /*
       * The trig involved in calculating the new width and height
       * is fairly simple; the hard part was remembering that when 
       * PI/2 <= theta <= PI and 3PI/2 <= theta < 2PI the width and 
       * height are switched.
       * 
       * When you rotate a rectangle, r, the bounding box surrounding r
       * contains for right-triangles of empty space.  Each of the 
       * triangles hypotenuse's are a known length, either the width or
       * the height of r.  Because we know the length of the hypotenuse
       * and we have a known angle of rotation, we can use the trig
       * function identities to find the length of the other two sides.
       * 
       * sine = opposite/hypotenuse
       * cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse
       * 
       * solving for the unknown we get
       * 
       * opposite = sine * hypotenuse
       * adjacent = cosine * hypotenuse
       * 
       * Another interesting point about these triangles is that there
       * are only two different triangles. The proof for which is easy
       * to see, but its been too long since I've written a proof that
       * I can't explain it well enough to want to publish it.  
       * 
       * Just trust me when I say the triangles formed by the lengths 
       * width are always the same (for a given theta) and the same 
       * goes for the height of r.
       * 
       * Rather than associate the opposite/adjacent sides with the
       * width and height of the original bitmap, I'll associate them
       * based on their position.
       * 
       * adjacent/oppositeTop will refer to the triangles making up the 
       * upper right and lower left corners
       * 
       * adjacent/oppositeBottom will refer to the triangles making up 
       * the upper left and lower right corners
       * 
       * The names are based on the right side corners, because thats 
       * where I did my work on paper (the right side).
       * 
       * Now if you draw this out, you will see that the width of the 
       * bounding box is calculated by adding together adjacentTop and 
       * oppositeBottom while the height is calculate by adding 
       * together adjacentBottom and oppositeTop.
